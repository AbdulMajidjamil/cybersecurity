📩 Mail Analysis & Mail Investigation.

⚠️Sample Mail phishing attack types:
💣 Attachment: analysis of it on any Sandbox: https://github.com/AbdulMajidjamil/cybersecurity/blob/main/Top%2029%20Cybersecurity%20SandBox
💣 Html page: analysis it on URL Scan for example: urlscan.io/
💣 Blackmail: Tell the Information security team

📩 First, let me explain the basics of the mail:
🔰 Mail User Agent (MUA) Computer Application that allows you to send and receive mail (Firefox Thunderbird, Microsoft Outlook,….etc).
🔰 Mail Submission Agent (MSA) the server that receives the message from the MUA and sends it to the MTA.
MTA is the server that takes the message from the application and sends it to
🔰 Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) Accepts message from the (MSA), route it, and forward outgoing e-mails for delivery.  
Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) Server that provides the mail message to the recipient after successful authentication.

📩 Second, DMRK Record
⚠️ SPF Record helps servers verify that messages coming from a particular domain are sent from servers authorized by the domain owner.
It tells me which domain is allowed to send a mail using my name (meaning the ip: 1.1.1.1 or domain: example )
(example.com) They allowed him to send email using the domain
SPF: example.com: 1.1.1.1

👽For example; SPF Record (Google.com)
is: v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
👽To check SPF Record: mxtoolbox.com/spf.aspx


⚠️ DKIM adds digital signature to every message. This lets receiving servers verify that messages are not forgotten and not changed during transit.
I mean, what is this word,,, simply, you take the body of the tendency and make it a hash after that
 Publishing for public key
 Private key
MDA When you reach the other side at the recipient
 Decryption with public key
hash that you follow from the other side and see the
It is the same as the one that followed it, and it does not change.
